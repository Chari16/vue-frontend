<p>When I sit down and write and recite for the mic I hold
Make sure my beats are loud and bold and Cold
187, that is my name, makin' it simple and plain
Here to rearrange and change
The things that I couldn't do in the past
Don't be surprised when you got a shotgun up your ass
Perpetrators, that one was just for you</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>
I'm gonna leave ya in your seat remaining without a clue
Glued to my style like a fiend on coke
But if you say the wrong thing, I wash your mouth out with soap
Dope is not the answer
No, I'm not a Cancer
No, I'm not a hero or zero
But a Leo in stereo
And this is not a demo
K-Oss and Go Mack be cuttin' the flex tempo fast

Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well
Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well
Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well
Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well</p>
